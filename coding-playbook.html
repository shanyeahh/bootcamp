		<h2>Little tid<em>bits</em> ...</h2>
		<p>If needed within this HTML document, codes and tags can be displayed by placing them between an opening code tag and a closing code tag.</p>

		<h3>The War Between Italics/Bold & Emphasis/Strong!</h3>
		<p>There is a difference between using italics or bold HTML tags versus using the emphasis HTML tag. This all comes down to importance. <i>Italics</i> or <b>bold</b> tags simply draw attention to text without indicating it's importance relevant to the webpage's other text. We would use <em>this emphasis tag</em> to stress importance while the aformentioned tags could be used for refering to the title of a literary work, for example. Did we mention there's also a <strong>strong</strong> HTML tag as well?</p>

		<p>Adding to the confusion is the fact that while HTML 4 defined <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> as indicating a stronger emphasis, HTML 5 defines <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> as representing "strong importance for its contents." This is an important distinction to make.</p>

		<p>While <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I <em>love</em> carrots" vs. "I love <em>carrots</em>"), <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "<strong>Warning!</strong> This is <strong>very dangerous.</strong>") Both <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.</p>
