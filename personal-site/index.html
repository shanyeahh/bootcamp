		<p><em>Aspiring web developer, writer and multi-passionate creative.</em></p>
		<p>Hello! First and foremost, I believe you have to <em>own</em> the title before you truly embody it. Imposter syndrome strikes in so many ways and this is one of my methods for fighting it. So I <strong>am</strong> a writer who is penning several works of both fiction and nonfiction. I love a hot cup of peppermint tea and a good yoga session in the morning.</p>

		<h3>Works (in Progress)</h3>
			<li><i>Is It Soup Yet?</i> - a novel highlighting Black romance and overcoming inability to be vulnerable with those who want to support us the most, with a backsplash of the local restuarant scene.</li>
			<li><i>Spilled Potions</i> - a short novella centered around a weekend whirlwind romance between a mage and a bard at a gaming convention.</li>
			<li><i>The Vanity of Orelia Hawk</i> - a short story about the ultimate fate of a sea-faring woman and her crew.</li>
