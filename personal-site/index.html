			<p><em>Aspiring web developer, writer and multi-passionate creative.</em></p>
			<p>Hello! First and foremost, I believe you have to <em>own</em> the title before you truly embody it. Imposter syndrome strikes in so many ways and this is one of my methods for fighting it. So I <strong>am</strong> a writer who is penning several works of both fiction and nonfiction. I love a hot cup of peppermint tea and a good yoga session in the morning.</p>

		<h3>Relevant Education & Work Experience</h3>
		<p>Prior to engaging the skills and work that I enjoy, I grew in predominately the customer service industry. From retail to restuarant to call center/office culture, my time in customer service spans over a decade. I wouldn't trade that time for anything because I learned highly important soft skills but also know that said soft skills can be applied to many different industries when honed and combined with technical skills. I have taken several online courses to hone my toolbox of skills, including on Udemy, Skillshare, and more. Click <a href="edu.html" target="_blank">here</a> for more details!
