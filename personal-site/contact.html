			<p>Hello! First and foremost, I believe you have to <em>own</em> the title before you truly embody it. Imposter syndrome strikes in so many ways and this is one of my methods for fighting it. So I <strong>am</strong> a writer who is penning several works of both fiction and nonfiction. I love a hot cup of peppermint tea and a good yoga session in the morning.</p></td>
